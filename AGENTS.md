This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

## No Codebase Present Yet

This is a new project, and the codebase has not been initialized yet. Therefore, there are no project-specific build/lint/test commands, code style guidelines, or architectural patterns to document at this time. Once the codebase is introduced, this file will be updated with relevant, non-obvious information discovered through file analysis.
